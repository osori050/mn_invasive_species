-- 1) A SQL query that involves only 1 table.
-- Find the number of terrestrial observations per county and sort them in descending order
SELECT county_name, count(county_name) AS number_of_observations, ST_Union(geom)
FROM terrestrial_invasive_species_observations
GROUP BY county_name
ORDER BY number_of_observations DESC


-- 2) A SQL query that involves 2 or more tables.
-- Find the number of all the invasive species observations per county and sort them in descending order
WITH invasive_species AS
(
SELECT county_name, geom FROM terrestrial_invasive_species_observations
UNION
SELECT county_name, geom FROM aquatic_invasive_species_observations

FROM invasive_species
WHERE county_name IS NOT NULL  -- Important to remove the null data so that the query runs
GROUP BY county_name
ORDER BY number_of_observations DESC

-- 3) A SQL query using a subquery or a common table expression
-- Find the land cover classes affected by wildfires and sort them in descending order

-- 4) A spatial SQL query
-- Terrestrial invasive species that colonized after a wildfire. The datasets need to be transformed into a projected coordinate system.
